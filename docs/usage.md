## Usage
after you finished installing `wind` all you have to do is visit the url `/admin` to manage the Letters,
and `/wind` to access the contact form.

check the configuration section for more details

if you don't have a user, or it's a fresh installation of laravel, you can use the command to create a new user
```bash
php artisan make:filament-user
```
